## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Barrosleo/Phishing-Detection-System.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Phishing-Detection-System/src
    ```
3. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
    ```
4. Preprocess the data:
    ```bash
